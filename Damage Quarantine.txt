Damage Quarantine and Recovery in Data Processing Systems:

Damage Quarantine:
 --- > Process Used to identify the affected or damaged data and to isolate it to reduce/mitigate 
       the risk or damage so that existing data can be protected.

 1. Identifying and flagging compromised data or systems.
 2. isolating that affected data from the rest of the data/network.
 3. Preventing further access to or modification of the compromised data 
 
 
Damage Recovery: 
----> Restoring the compromised data or systems to previously known good state. (backup)

  1. Restoring data from backups.
  2. Rebuilding the systems or applications.
  3. Apply patches(updates) to fix the vulnarabilities.
  4. Verifying the data integrity and accuracy ( No modifications)
   
 incident(error/bug/issue)  /  ticket (epic, story, task, subtask, bug ) 
 
Key Points:
 1. Backup and restore
 2. Error Detection and correction
 3. Redundancy- duplicating the critical data
 4. Incident response planning.
 5. continuous Monitoring.
